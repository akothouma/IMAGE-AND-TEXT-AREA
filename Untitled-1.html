                I bought these speakers from Best Buy almost a year ago for $20 a pair. I use them as fronts for my Pioneer VSXD411 receiver,and have the KLH AV1001Bs as surrounds. Just so you know, home theater has just recently become a passion of mine, so I wouldn't call myself an audiophile. But I do know what sounds good to me. These are great as main speakers, although they appear to have a little distortion with high frequencies. This is only noticeable occasionally, since I mostly use them for movie sound. The bass is more than ample. Movies like the Matrix and Lord of the Rings sound rich & full, even when not using a sub!
